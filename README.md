**__D I S C L A M E R :__** *This fork adds modiciations to depcreate the mod and make it compatible with JAVA 12+! That means that with this fork the mod will not longer generate new rivers but keeps the existing ones to not destroy your existing work. This mod is intented to be used explicitely with my [Streams fork](https://github.com/Pilzinsel64/Streams)https://github.com/Pilzinsel64/Streams!*

- This mod has updated to the latest GTNH build script
- All world + structure generation features are probably borken now! *(Streams Mod has been updated already)*
- The client config feature and all the Reflection utilities has been removed!
- All the changes were required to get this Mod working on Java 12+ (tested on Java 17 but should also work up to Java 20)
